Hi I am working on react native app. The app is a counceling platform where users with different mental problems will come and get councelling guidelines. App has 2 sides (councelor side and user side). currently i am working on user side. I am using nativewind for styling and the theme of my app is COLORS.themeColor as theme color(export const COLORS = {themeColor: "#6C63FF",lightThemeColor: "#C4C0FF",success: "#10B981",background: "#000000",grey: "#9CA3AF"}) and bg-gray-50 as background. Hope you understood my app 
make me a loader component that uses a very modern looking UI. it can be something like a brain creation or anything mistical that suites apps like mystic Aura. also it should be like an svg animating in a line like form or anything.
