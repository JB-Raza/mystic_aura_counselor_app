fix the intro screen UI
decrease the font size in the whole app as it is too big for phones
findout how to preload the screens (under normal priority which means that first load the important parts like landing screen and its components, then the tab screens that other screens.) and resources while the app is in idle state so that user doesn't have to wait while navigating.

an i do something that first the layout gets loaded then the logic.
can i somehow set the priority of each screen or component in which they will be loaded.
like the landing screen is most important, load it first, then the tab screens are important. then load them, then other screens , load them.
also lets say if user opened the app. he is at home screen. lets say he stayed there for about 5 seconds. now till that time the app is doing nothing. can i somehow utilize that time and in that time, download the other parts of my app so that when user goes to those screens, it don't have to wait alot.

Hi I am working on react native app. The app is a counceling platform where users with different mental problems will come and get councelling guidelines. App has 2 sides (councelor side and user side). currently i am working on user side. I am using nativewind for styling and the theme of my app is COLORS.themeColor as theme color(export const COLORS = {themeColor: "#6C63FF",lightThemeColor: "#C4C0FF",success: "#10B981",background: "#000000",grey: "#9CA3AF"}) and bg-gray-50 as background. Hope you understood my app 
make me a loader component that uses a very modern looking UI. it can be something like a brain creation or anything mistical that suites apps like mystic Aura. also it should be like an svg animating in a line like form or anything.
